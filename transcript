[8:30:44 AM] Synthovine: I just wanna tell you this shit because I want you to be prepared for shit that might happen
[8:30:51 AM] Synthovine: I don't condone this and these people dislike you a lot more than I do
[8:31:19 AM] Synthovine: I have issues with you because I think you leak info and shit too early, but this is still something you should be aware of
[8:31:26 AM] Synthovine: people are going to try and get you to lose your job man
[8:31:32 AM] Synthovine: coming through the grape vine
[8:31:49 AM] Synthovine: this is shit that I hear, people who dislike what you do on a level I can't even compare with
[8:32:00 AM] Synthovine: I don't know who they are, but I've heard people talking about it
[8:32:09 AM] Kingofpol: So you have issues with me because of how i handle my way of doing things?
[8:32:19 AM] Synthovine: I think the way you do things is fine
[8:32:24 AM] Synthovine: I just don't agree with it
[8:32:33 AM] Synthovine: you can be the howard stern of this as far as I'm concerned
[8:32:38 AM] Synthovine: I think we do need someone like that
[8:32:43 AM] Synthovine: even if I don't agree with it
[8:33:04 AM] Synthovine: I don't care enough to be doing this doxx shit that people are
[8:33:07 AM] Synthovine: but it's shit I've heard
[8:33:12 AM] Kingofpol: Look tbh idc what you feel or think man im going to do what i do if you dont like it take a number bro. If you dont agree take another number its not about me or sargon or IA at all. Jist people with viewpoints and different ways of getting things out there. So im glad you uh, shared that with me but tbh i dont care at all
[8:33:15 AM] Synthovine: I don't mean to frame it as a veiled threat coming frm me
[8:33:39 AM] Synthovine: because that's not what it is
[8:33:47 AM] Synthovine: it's people who dislike you on a level miuuuuuuuuuuuch further than me
[8:33:51 AM] Synthovine: that want to fuck with you irl
[8:34:01 AM] Kingofpol: But i dont care
[8:34:09 AM] Kingofpol: If you dont like me then dont talk to me?
[8:34:10 AM] Synthovine: they want to go after your job and shit though
[8:34:18 AM] Synthovine: that's what I want you to know
[8:34:19 AM] Kingofpol: And i care again why?
[8:34:23 AM] Kingofpol: Let them
[8:34:27 AM] Kingofpol: It does not effect me
[8:34:30 AM] Synthovine: I just want you to be aware though
[8:34:33 AM] Kingofpol: At all i show my HR a stream
[8:34:37 AM] Kingofpol: Thru go oh its politics
[8:34:39 AM] Kingofpol: I go yes
[8:34:43 AM] Kingofpol: They say okay bye
[8:34:49 AM] Kingofpol: I literally dont care
[8:35:01 AM] Synthovine: alright man, I just want you to know that it's coming, and again, it's not coming from me and I don't support it
[8:35:06 AM] Synthovine: but it's shit I've heard through the grape vine
[8:35:21 AM] Kingofpol: And where r u hearing people wanting to attack my job exactly?
[8:35:21 AM] Synthovine: that people dislike you on a level I couldn't even approach
[8:35:34 AM] Synthovine: through sources I can't confirm, so I don't want to go there
[8:35:41 AM] Synthovine: I just want you to know that you're just at the beginning of it
[8:35:42 AM] Kingofpol: Why then why dont u share them with me so i know who to give to the poloce if they do act
[8:35:48 AM] Kingofpol: Do they come into the calls?
[8:35:55 AM] Kingofpol: Or do they just shitpost
[8:36:00 AM] Kingofpol: Literally who
[8:36:25 AM] Synthovine: I know what you're asking and they're not around right now
[8:36:36 AM] Synthovine: let me wait until they're around and see if they're willing to talk to you?
[8:36:40 AM] Kingofpol: Uh huh so they come into calls? And threatened my job?
[8:36:41 AM] Synthovine: where this info came from
[8:36:49 AM] Kingofpol: Thats all i neex to know
[8:36:49 AM] Synthovine: no, it's not necessarily the person who comes into the calls
[8:36:56 AM] Kingofpol: Uh huh
[8:36:57 AM] Synthovine: it's just where the info originates from
[9:18:26 AM] Synthovine: I just want you to be aware man, I'm sorry if I worded it poorly
[9:18:38 AM] Synthovine: it's not that the people in the call are untrustworthy
[9:18:51 AM] Synthovine: it's that they know the groups who want to do this shit
[9:20:25 AM] Synthovine: I'm just trying to give you the heads up that people are setting up the bomb on you, so to speak

Synthovine[01]
Synthovine: is there a problem?
[9/28/2014 9:13:28 AM] (G)Secret Squaff: What you told KingofPol yes.
[9/28/2014 9:13:35 AM] (G)Secret Squaff: we are talking it over.
[9/28/2014 9:13:38 AM] Synthovine: ok
[9/28/2014 9:13:50 AM] Synthovine: I didn't mean it as a threat, just that he needs to be aware that it's going to happen
[9/28/2014 9:14:34 AM] (G)Secret Squaff: Other people have been leaving the call since
[9/28/2014 9:14:38 AM] Synthovine: my personal gripe with him is completely separate from that, I was just being honest
[9/28/2014 9:15:10 AM] Synthovine: but just let me know
[9/28/2014 9:17:20 AM] (G)Secret Squaff: I'm not going to be nice about this, but if other think you just said some dumb/honest, then I'll readd you.
[9/28/2014 9:17:41 AM] (G)Secret Squaff: I've listen to you give this guy shit for days now.
[9/28/2014 9:21:01 AM] Synthovine: honestly, I don't think the people who are going to do this to him are in the call
[9/28/2014 9:21:19 AM] Synthovine: I don't think they've ever been, and it's irrelevant mostly, but I brought it up because I felt like he needs to be aware
[9/28/2014 9:21:34 AM] Synthovine: that if he keeps going, they're going to try and hit him in specific ways, and it's fucked up
[9/28/2014 9:21:46 AM] Synthovine: just wanted him to be aware/prepared, and I know it sounds bad, but it's going to happen
[9/28/2014 9:22:05 AM] Synthovine: I would never wish that on anyone, regardless of how I feel about what they speak on
[9/28/2014 9:22:45 AM] Synthovine: though I do feel his position and his message and the way he speaks on things i very damaging to GG
[9/29/2014 2:06:31 PM] Synthovine: ask Thidran
[9/29/2014 2:06:42 PM] Synthovine: that's who told me, but I was trying to get him and kop to talk directly
[9/29/2014 2:06:51 PM] Synthovine: but kop flipped shit and left, so I just left it
[9/29/2014 2:07:10 PM] Synthovine: or that's what I wanted to do anyway after he said that and I said they're not online
[9/29/2014 2:09:00 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: Are you fucking kidding me? Are you so stupid you would believe Thidran? Have you listened to him? And you want to talk about how bad POL is with conspiracies?
[9/29/2014 2:09:18 PM] Synthovine: thidran is a trusted source many times over
[9/29/2014 2:09:47 PM] Synthovine: if you disagree that's your opinion
[9/29/2014 2:10:12 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: That's not an opinion. Goonswarm isn't taking over the world.
[9/29/2014 2:10:25 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: You ruined contacts over what Thidran had to say?
[9/29/2014 2:11:08 PM] Synthovine: again, that's your opinion and you don't know everything about the goos' involvement and neither do I, but I do believe he's trustworthy because he's been that plenty of times in the past to me
[9/29/2014 2:11:29 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: goos? You mean goons?
[9/29/2014 2:11:34 PM] Synthovine: yeah, sorry
[9/29/2014 2:17:04 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: I'm not hosting calls containing you and Thidran anymore, maybe one last more to let everyone have that transparency you two arent giving. Between you and Thidran trash talking pol, the full transcript, and the fact that, even if you were being honest, it means you believe goons have come together, en mass, to get POL and his ilk fired.
[9/29/2014 2:17:53 PM] Synthovine: I nevre said that either about goons getting him fires
[9/29/2014 2:17:54 PM] Synthovine: fired
[9/29/2014 2:18:05 PM] Synthovine: you're connecting two different pieces of information
[9/29/2014 2:19:19 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: Very vague info that looks like a veiled threat.
[9/29/2014 2:19:41 PM] Synthovine: if that's your interpretation, I can't change it
[9/29/2014 2:19:53 PM] Synthovine: I don't like the guy, but I was genuinely concerned when I heard it
[9/29/2014 2:19:56 PM] Synthovine: so I wanted to bring it to his attention
[9/29/2014 2:20:15 PM] Synthovine: I did it poorly, I admitted it, that's all I can say
[9/29/2014 2:20:43 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: How many people do you think came to that interpretation?
[9/29/2014 2:21:19 PM] Synthovine: I have no clue, but I honestly think people are probably 50/50 on it
[9/29/2014 2:21:43 PM] Synthovine: I don't know who's doxxing him or who might be, again, you'd have to ask Thidran
[9/29/2014 2:22:50 PM] Synthovine: I was trying to be helpful, sory if it came across wrong
[9/29/2014 2:23:55 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: came across wrong? Are you insane?

Thidran[02]
(G)Secret Squaff: ask Thidran
that's who told me, but I was trying to get him and kop to talk directly
but kop flipped shit and left, so I just left it
or that's what I wanted to do anyway after he said that and I said they're not online
[9/29/2014 3:23:46 PM] Thidran: Just woke up.
[9/29/2014 3:24:50 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: https://github.com/squaff/kingofpol-v-synth/blob/master/transcript
[9/29/2014 3:25:43 PM] Thidran: Reading transcript.
[9/29/2014 3:28:59 PM] Thidran: Alright.
[9/29/2014 3:29:13 PM] Thidran: Do you want to know anything more specific?
[9/29/2014 3:29:53 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: What the hell is wrong with you two?
[9/29/2014 3:29:57 PM] Thidran: KoP?
[9/29/2014 3:31:02 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: you and synthovine
[9/29/2014 3:31:24 PM] Thidran: In summation: I have access to differing sources than ya'll.
[9/29/2014 3:31:32 PM] Thidran: That's the only reason I am of use here.
[9/29/2014 3:31:45 PM] Thidran: Take what I say with a grain of salt of course.
[9/29/2014 3:32:44 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: Did you and Synth talk something over before this transcript hit?
[9/29/2014 3:32:47 PM] Thidran: I can't say for Synth's sources, other than mine are different than his, and digs elsewhere.
[9/29/2014 3:33:13 PM] Thidran: I've been trying to warn KoP in chat about that shit, and talking about him way beforehand.
[9/29/2014 3:33:33 PM] Thidran: The more he gets built up, the worse it'll be for him.
[9/29/2014 3:33:46 PM] Thidran: He's puffing himself up, and worse, he's giving out personal information on the stream.
[9/29/2014 3:34:00 PM] Thidran: It wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't speaking to upwards of 5k people at once.
[9/29/2014 3:34:14 PM] Thidran: But he's slowly being made into a symbolic leader, which is going to really hurt him down the line.
[9/29/2014 3:34:28 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: No. Synthovine said you were the one giving him his info.
[9/29/2014 3:34:40 PM] Thidran: Correct. As I said, I have different sources than him.
[9/29/2014 3:35:01 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: Did you tell Synthovine your sources?
[9/29/2014 3:35:05 PM] Thidran: Cannot.
[9/29/2014 3:35:20 PM] Thidran: That's why I say take whatever I say with a grain of salt.
[9/29/2014 3:36:00 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: So you two cannot share these sources and yet you both thought it was a good idea to tell KingOfPOL. One of you choosing to do so while he was paranoid.
[9/29/2014 3:36:14 PM] Thidran: I've told him earlier than that.
[9/29/2014 3:36:17 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: And then there was the two of you calling him the 5th column.
[9/29/2014 3:36:20 PM] Thidran: He shrugged it off.
[9/29/2014 3:36:29 PM] Thidran: And note that I've been accusing him of that long before Synth.
[9/29/2014 3:38:42 PM] Thidran: For example: Rather than blame his current misfortunes on any of the random trolls who have likely gained access to his public information due to all of his disclosures, he decided to attack Synthovine directly.
[9/29/2014 3:39:03 PM] Thidran: Or how he keeps releasing relatively private information public.
[9/29/2014 3:39:25 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: Okay, so because of you, and I hope you get that. Synthovine blabs his ass off about things he doesn't know based on contacts you cannot share and gets King, Milo, Sargon, TB, and others to not want to talk to about us.
[9/29/2014 3:40:03 PM] Thidran: Not surprised to be blunt.
[9/29/2014 3:41:47 PM] Thidran: You can blame me, but the truth is, KoP is directly responsible for some of that. Remember, I joined here later on. I was in BnF beforehand.
[9/29/2014 3:42:32 PM] Thidran: So if I am directly responsible for KiA not being talked about, then it would've had to have happened after I came onto KiA stuff, when apparently it did not.
[9/29/2014 3:43:20 PM] Thidran: Did he ever bother talking about KiA for instance?
[9/29/2014 3:43:29 PM] Thidran: I certainly didn't see that from the start of his streams.
[9/29/2014 3:44:13 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: I'm not here to discuss anything but that transcript and your involvement.
[9/29/2014 3:44:28 PM] Thidran: I'm merely pointing out a few flaws in your theory is all.
[9/29/2014 3:45:06 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: There is no flaw and it's not a theory. You admit you fed Synthovine this shit.
[9/29/2014 3:45:17 PM] Thidran: It's not shit is my counter.
[9/29/2014 3:45:31 PM] Thidran: Up to you to believe it or not.
[9/29/2014 3:45:36 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: If it's not shit, provide your sources.
[9/29/2014 3:45:46 PM] Thidran: Nope.
[9/29/2014 3:45:50 PM] Thidran: Welcome to not believe me.
[9/29/2014 3:45:53 PM] Thidran: You are welcome to it.
[9/29/2014 3:48:02 PM] (G)Secret Squaff: That's all I needed to know, Thidran.
[9/29/2014 3:48:21 PM] Thidran: Works for me. Good luck.
